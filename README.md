# Predicting Maryland Home Prices and Finding their Value

### What is your issue of interest (provide sufficient background information)?

I would like to create a model on predicting home prices in Maryland as well as potentially finding value in certain home based on a buyers preferences.  In today's very competitive market, it is difficult for first time home buyers like myself to jump into.  Prices are high and so are desires for a home, so a model in finding homes that are undervalued or give the most value for as pertains to what the buyer can afford and wants could be a huge help and make the home decision for the buyer that much easier.  At the same time, investors may also be interested in this model as it relates to finding value in certain properties that are good for positive cash flow based on its features.

### Why is this issue important to you and/or to others?

The issue is important to me as a first time home buyer because there are so many things to consider and weighing the decisions is difficult to do.  I think seeing the price differential between home in certain areas, or certain styles, with different features will give me a better understanding of where exactly the value in a home comes from and what areas, styles, and features are most costly.  With that, I can better weigh the cost of that location, style, or feature to make a better informed decision about the home I'd like to purchase.  I think this has the potential for me to input weights into features that I care about, say for example, I place the weight of a 10 on the location being Annapolis, but only a 3 on it having 3 bedrooms, with that information the model could find homes with the most value based on the weights I give it.

### What questions do you have in mind and would like to answer?

The questions I have in mind are what areas, styles, and features of the home cost the most, and based on that what homes then offer the most value for their cost?  I think a lot of people try to make a decision that offers them the best value for their money.  With that, they would be very interested to the answer to the question about how to find the most value to them in the home that they buy.

### Where do you get the data to analyze and help answer your questions (creditability of source, quality of data, size of data, attributes of data. etc.)?



### What will be your unit of analysis (for example, patient, organization, or country)? Roughly how many units (observations) do you expect to analyze?



### What variables/measures do you plan to use in your analysis (variables should be tied to the questions in #3)?



### What kinds of techniques/models do you plan to use (for example, clustering, NLP, ARIMA, etc.)?



### How do you plan to develop/apply ML and how you evaluate/compare the performance of the models?



### What outcomes do you intend to achieve (better understanding of problems, tools to help solve problems, predictive analytics with practicle applications, etc)?
